d tears, we learn to cope,
In the symphony of life, every note is hope.
With each passing day, a chance to grow,
To reap the seeds that we sow.

In the tapestry of moments, woven with care,
We find beauty in the simplest fare.
For life is a gift, a precious gem,
To cherish and embrace, in joy and whim.

So let us savor each fleeting hour,
And drink deeply from love's sweet bower.
For in the end, when all is said and done,
Life's true measure is how we've loved and won.
